Developing a Python Chattybot using Flask and Natural Language Processing
Project Description: In this project, we aim to create a simple chatbot that can converse with users in natural language. To accomplish this, we will be using Flask, a micro web framework for Python, to build the web application that will serve as the interface for our chattybot. We will also leverage natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to enable the chattybot to understand and respond to user messages.

To start, we will gather and prepare a dataset of conversational data to train our NLP model. Next, we will build and train the deep learning model using tools such as TensorFlow. Once we have a trained model, we will integrate it with the Flask web application to create a functional chattybot that users can interact with.
